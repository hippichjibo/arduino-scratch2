# arduino-scratch2

Authors: Kyra Post, Randi Williams, Pablo Alejo-Aguirre

Code adapted from [Kreg Hanning](http://khanning.github.io/scratch-arduino-extension) and [LOFI Robot Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lofi-robot-extension/opdjdfckgbogbagnkbkpjgficbampcel?hl=en) and [LOFI Robot ScratchX Extension](https://github.com/LoFiRobot/Scratch/blob/gh-pages/lofirobot_chrome.js).

## About
This project began with making a Scratch Extension for an Arduino-based Jibo robot. It has since extended to the development of a Chromebook friendly Arduino implementation. It has been tested with the [PopPet Robot](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jaidynedwards/poppet-diy-arduino-compatible-open-hardware-robot) developed by [Jaidyn Edwards](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC340dy5bmr6sLpyRh5qYwrg) and the Gizmo Robot, a derivative of PopPet developed by the Personal Robots Group at the MIT Media Lab.

Using this code, anyone can make an Arduino Scratch Extension that works on Chromebooks.

## Help
After updating code, in order to see your changes on the SratchX project site you will have to do the following Git commands:
1. Add changed files to the commit using ```git add <filename1> <filename2> ...```
2. Commit the commit and create a descriptive commit message using ```git commit```
    * You can also do a one-liner using ```git commit -m "<commit message>"```
3. Pull current code from the remote (origin) master branch ```git pull origin master```
4. Push your current code to the remote (origin) master branch ```git push origin master```
5. All done! Check [the site](http://scratchx.org/?url=https://mitmedialab.github.io/arduino-scratch2/arduino_extension.js).
